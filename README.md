# A statistics package for Raku
This is just a small personal project for me to learn what actually goes into creating scientific software.

TODO:

- [ ] find a better way to approximate distridution functions

Right now the best precision is about 4 digits after the secimal point, which is *okay* for doing calculations by hand but not for a computer

- [ ] add more distributions...

- [ ] add more statistical tests...
