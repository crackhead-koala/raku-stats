# A statistics package for Raku
This is just a small personal project for me to learn more about statistical computing.

TODO:

- [x] find a better way to approximate distribution functions...

I switched to using native calls and functions from the GNU Scientific Library.

- [ ] add more distributions...

- [ ] add more statistical tests...
